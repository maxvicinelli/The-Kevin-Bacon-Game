# The-Kevin-Bacon-Game

This was assignment was the fourth lab for the course COSC10: Problem Solving using Object Oriented Programming. I was given a long .txt file of actors and the movies they had been in, and I was tasked with finding any inputted actors "Kevin Bacon Number", or the degrees of separation in movies from the inputted actor to Kevin Bacon. 
I created a graph from the given data, and performed BFS to find the degrees of separation. There is additional functionality, such as switching the "center of universe" from Kevin Bacon, finding which actor is the best center of the universe, and more.
